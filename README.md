# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This was made possible using flexbox, grid, and media queries. The profile information was made using flexbox and grid combined to make it responsive. There is also a media query that reorganizes the profile information once it gets smaller than 480px. This makes the website look better on mobile devices. display: grid; was used to create the card gallery with all the images. The number of columns
depends on the user's screen size. Overall, this website was made to practice the new skills (grid and media queries) I have learned in order to make a responsive website.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
